# machine
This repository sets up a machine with my preferred tools. It aims to work on
both an Ubuntu and a Mac OS X machine.

It is written in bash script to ensure portability and ease the setup process.

## Install
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/majjoha/machine.git
$ machine/bootstrap
```

## Inspiration
This project is loosely inspired by the
[thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) and
[rdegges/ubootstrap](https://github.com/rdegges/ubootstrap) repositories.
